# Project description 
The Movie-API is a backend application that I developed using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express. It serves as an API for managing a movie database, facilitating communication between a client-side application and a MongoDB non-relational database. This API enables operations like user authentication, movie data retrieval, and user-specific operations such as managing a list of favorite movies.

# Objective
To build the server-side component of "movies" web application. the web application  provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
